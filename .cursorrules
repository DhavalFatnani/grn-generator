# GRN Generator Project Rules

## Project Overview
This is a React-based GRN (Goods Received Note) Generator application built with Vite. The application allows users to upload CSV files, generate GRN documents, and export them in various formats.

## Technology Stack
- React 18
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- LocalStorage for data persistence
- XLSX library for Excel exports

## Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer named exports for components
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for components
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use useCallback and useMemo for performance optimization when needed

## File Structure
- `/src/components/` - React components
- `/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `/src/utils/` - Utility functions and constants
- `/src/App.jsx` - Main application component
- `/src/App.css` - Global styles

## Key Features
1. File upload (Purchase Order, Put Away, QC Fail)
2. GRN generation with header information
3. Admin authentication and team member management
4. Excel/CSV/HTML/PDF export
5. Dark mode support
6. GRN Management (logs storage)

## State Management
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback)
- LocalStorage for persistence (admin data, team members, GRN logs)
- Context API for theme management

## Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS classes primarily
- Custom CSS in App.css for complex styles
- Dark mode: Use `.dark` prefix for dark mode styles
- Maintain consistent spacing and color scheme
- Ensure proper contrast in both light and dark modes

## Data Storage
- Admin credentials: localStorage with hashed passwords
- Team members: localStorage key `grn_admin_team_members`
- GRN logs: localStorage key `grn_logs`
- Theme preference: localStorage key `theme`

## Export Formats
- CSV: Enhanced Excel format (XLSX) with formatting
- HTML: Interactive GRN document
- PDF: Print-ready format

## Authentication
- Simple password-based authentication
- Default credentials: admin / admin123
- Session management via localStorage

## Testing
- Test mode available (Ctrl+Shift+T or Cmd+Shift+T)
- Sample data templates for quick testing
