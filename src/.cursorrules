# Source Code Rules

## Component Guidelines
- Keep components under 300 lines when possible
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use prop destructuring for cleaner code
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript types if needed

## Hook Guidelines
- Custom hooks should start with `use`
- Keep hooks focused on single responsibility
- Return objects for multiple values, arrays for ordered pairs

## Utility Functions
- Keep utilities pure functions when possible
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Group related utilities in the same file

## Error Handling
- Use try-catch for async operations
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Log errors to console for debugging

## Performance
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Use useCallback for event handlers passed to children
- Use useMemo for expensive calculations
- Lazy load heavy components if needed
